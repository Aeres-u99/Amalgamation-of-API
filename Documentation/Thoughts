Well thinking about code after we have written it is irritating tbh, so I planned to write somethigns and my thoghts as I am going with the programming part
NOw the thing we are working on is planned to be going this way that we acquire 1 of the three things 
1) Ip address
2) Ip address of the request
3) Lat lon
the above 2 will be used to obtain lat lon at the third end.
everything and anything else is bound to be discarded
Now with ip we are going to fetch the lattitudes and longitudes 
that is, use ip-api.com to fetch the lat lon and use it 
lat lon are parameters for weather api.
